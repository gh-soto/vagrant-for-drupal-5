Requirements
------------

This version of the module requires Drupal 5


Installation
------------

0. If the default Drupal forum module is enabled then go to admin >> modules and
   disable it. This isn't a required step, but it is advised.

1. Place the UIEForum module with all its files and folders under sites/all/modules/uieforum.

2. Enable the new forum module in
   admin >> modules
   look for the module called uieforum here and tick the associated radio box

   .install file will automatically run to import the mysql settings needed

2a. Run the update.php file for your site to force uieforum to run its updates, if neccessary
   http://www.site.com/update.php

3. Configure required permissions in
   admin >> user management >> access control

4. Set the module settings to your liking in
   admin >> content management >> uieforum.


!VERY IMPORTANT NOTE!
---------------------

1. Three user groups are included with the base install by default, 'access forum',
   'post new threads/posts' and 'administer forum'.

   *IMPORTANT*
   Do NOT modify these 3 groups in any way, they are required for the module to
   function correctly.
   The default forum: "Forums" is installed for you.

     * It is EXTREMELY important that this forum is not modified, unless done so via
       a mysql command prompt - and even then only to change it's name.

     * If its 'ParentForum' is set to ANYTHING except 'NULL' then your webserver
       _will_ fall over and die a horrible, horrible death.
       This is due to the recursive functions within the module, they rely on all
       forums having a ParentForum. The <root> forum's parent, should be null.

     * Multiple root forums is currently NOT possible. Don't try doing it. It won't
       be a nice experience for you. And I can't be held responsible for your poor
       little webserver falling over and screaming the rooftops down if you decide to
       ignore this warning.


Configuration Options
---------------------

0. Your forum will be accessible at http://www.yoursite.com/uieforum - this can be
   changed! Go to admin >> content management >> uieforum >> configure >> paths, and set
   the "Forum Access Path:" to whatever you desire. Remember to read the description
   about the setting below the input box first though.

1. Go to admin >> content management >> uieforum >> configure >> paths ... and set the
   icon paths to wherever your required set of icons are.

     * This path is relative to the website root directory, and can be anywhere
       within that structure.

     * This will default to /sites/all//modules/uieforum/uie/ ... if you haven't changed the
       location of this file, or don't have your own icon sets you'd like to
       use you can skip this step

     * The same procedure can be used to alter the Smilies and the text
       formatting (bbcode) icons also.

2. Go to admin >> content management >> uieforum >> add forum and add your first forum.
   By default, the group 'administer forum' has unrestricted access to the forum
   module, so be sure to add your admin user to this group in "admin >> user management >> access
   control >> uieforum"


3. To create a private forum, first create the forum, then create a new security group
   via: admin >> content management >> uieforum >> add group
   Once created, edit the forum in question to allow access to only your new access
   group (the private one)
   Finally, add any users that should have access to this forum to a role within
   drupal's user access control system.

   Confused? :)

   Example:
     Create the forum: "Private"
     Create the forum security group: "forum private"/"forum_private_group"
     Go to admin >> content management >> uieforum  ... and edit "Private" to allow ONLY the
        private group access
     Go to admin >> user management >> access control >> roles ... and add your new drupal role
     Go to admin >> user management >> access control ... and add your new drupal role to the
        "forum private" access list
     Go to admin >> user management >> users >> *user name* ... and add the user in question to your
        new drupal role.
     *done* Your user(s) can now access the private forum :)
   While it may be awkward to follow, it really is extrememly logical in it's
   functionality - trust me :)
   I recommened that you try this a few times, and make sure that you understand
   exactly how it works - as it's likely that this will be one of your first problem
   areas.


4. To change the root breadcrumb (as displayed on the top and bottom of every forum page)
   you will need to modify the "Forum Title" entry on the congfiguration page


Upgrade
-------

MAKE A BACKUP.
You have been warned.

This behaviour is not specific to the UIEForum module it's for all Drupal
modules we just warn because we care :)

1: Backup the existing module folder (/sites/all/modules/uieforum/) in case
   you have made any changes to the code or files/images/css

2: Extract the uieforum zip to /sites/all/modules/uieforum/

3: Check any new configuration options in admin >> content management >> uieforum

4: All done!



UIEForum Block
--------------

1. Go to admin >> site building >> blocks ... and search the list for "uieforum" or 
   "Recent Forum Posts" ...  hit "configure"
   The number of recent posts/threads to show in this block can be configured here

The UIEForum module was originally heavily based on the forum.module code. It's structure
resembles the forum module in quite a few places, and this entire project simply could not
have been completed were it not for the forum.module file as a building block.

The BBCode module (http://drupal.org/project/bbcode - Goba + Frank) is built into this
forum system, making it all part + parcel.
This integration is temporary, and I'm looking at various other solutions to the problem
