Audio module dependencies
---------------------------
 * Drupal 5.0.
 * getID3 1.7.7 (http://getid3.org/) package for reading and writing audio
   metadata.


To install the audio module
---------------------------

1. Extract the 'audio' module directory, including all its subdirectories, into
   your sites/all/modules directory.

2. Install the getID3 package - optional but recommended. MAKE SURE YOU READ
   THE SECURITY NOTE BELOW!

   a. Download the project getId3 version from SourceForge.net. The latest
      version tested with the audio module is 1.7.7. Earlier versions contain
      bugs that will cause you headaches.

   b. Extract the archive into the sites/all/modules/audio/getid3 directory. When you're
      finished the directory structure should look something like:

        drupal/
          sites/
            all/
              modules/
                audio/
                  getid3/
                    README.txt
                    [...]
                    getid3/
                      getid3.php
                      write.php

  c. *** IMPORTANT ***
     YOU MUST DELETE THE 'demos' FOLDER OF THE ID3 LIBRARY. FAILURE TO DO SO
     OPENS UP A MASSIVE SECURITY HOLE AND MAKES YOUR SITE EXTREMELY VULNERABLE
     TO ATTACKS!

3. Enable the audio, audio_getid3 and audio_image modules on the
   admin >> build >> modules page. The database tables will be created 
   automagically for you at this point.

4. Go to admin >> settings >> audio and check that the path to the getID3
   package is configured correctly. If you follow the above directory
   structure, the path should be "sites/all/modules/audio/getid3/getid3/".
