How to use Views Node Feed:

1. Install Views Node Feed at admin/build/modules
2. Go to admin/settings/views_node_feed and create a node
   feed to specify the format your feed will be in.
3. Create a view that you will use to populate your feed
   with nodes. You can sort and filter these nodes just
   as you regularly would with views. The view should provide
   a page.
4. Add the "Node: Views Node Feed Selector" argument to the view
   and select the node feed you want to use under "option"
5. Access your view's node feed by adding /node_feed to the
   end of your view page URL
